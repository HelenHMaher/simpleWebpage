      <p>
        First considered a fungus, the Physarum polycephalum (literally translated to "many-headed slime") was
        reclassified in the 1990s as a slime-mold. One of the easiest eukaryotic microbs to grow and maintain in a lab
        setting, it is often used to study the movement of single-celled organisms. Having developed some 500 million
        years before the human, The Blob is one of the most resiliant forms of life on the planet. Neigh impossible to
        kill, it can hibernate for long periods of time, even surviving a trip in through the microwave. However, when
        conditions are favorable, it will grow a break-neck speeds, sometimes doubling in size overnight.</p>

        The Blob has garnered increasing media attention in recent years when it began being used in increasingly
        complicated and visually impressive experiments. The Blob moves slowly, meer centimeters over the course of an
        hour, but it does move and despite having no brain or central nervous system, it shows signs of being able to
        not only learn, but to remember. When subjected to extreme conditions of temperature as regular intervals, The
        Blob began anticipating the onset of those conditions at those intervals. The Blob has been found capable of
        solving mazes, and even reproducing transportation systems. In a 2010 paper, oatflakes were used to represent
        Tokyo and the surrounding towns and The Blob created a network similar to the train system being used there
        today.</p>

        When The Blob was introduced to the Paris Zoo in October of 2019, it was to much excitement. But because this
        scientific curiousity and organic marvel is relatively unassuming in its speed and flamboyance, the exhibit will
        also include filmed footage of its problem-solving accomplishments. </p>

      <p>
        Because of its ability to construct networks, scientists have been very interested in The Blob's potential in
        the area of bio-computing. It has been reported that The Blob has show the ability to logic gates. These reports
        have yet to be peer-reviewed and any model that would allow for actual computation remains mostly theoretical,
        but the groundwork is being layed. Much research remains to be done.</p>
